%    \item Construct general model with Encounter-based approach
    \item \tbf{Local Time} $\ell$ describes the general nature of surface phenomena: ``target-finding'' diffusion, activation, passivation, etc.   %How much time would one particle move near the complex surface?
    \item Implement ``encounter-based approach'' in the complex media with special geometrical confinements;% for $P(\mathbf{x},\ell,t|\mathbf{x}_0)$
  \item Study different mechanisms of surface reactions
  %with generalized propagator $G_\Psi(\mathbf{x},t|\mathbf{x}_0) = \int \mrm{d} \ell \Psi(\ell) P(\mathbf{x},\ell,t|\mathbf{x}_0)$
  by ``encouter-dependent reactivity'';
  %\item Collective effect of multiple independently diffusing particles;
  \item Identify experimental situations to validate;
  \end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
	    	\setlength{\itemsep}{6pt}
		\item[$\bullet$] Boundary local time $\ell_t$ characterizes the number of encounters with the boundary
		\item[$\bullet$] Surface reaction occurs when $\ell_t$ exceeds some threshold $\hat\ell$ characterized by $\Psi(\ell)$
		\large
		\begin{itemize}
          \item[$\star$] standard surface reactions $\Psi(\ell) = q e^{-q\ell}$
          \item[$\star$]  various surface reactions: arbitrary $\Psi(\ell)$
        \end{itemize}
		\item[$\bullet$] This approach was applied only in simple confinements like sphere.
